Let's start by making a very simple UI
1. Add a timer as a title
<h1 id="timer">25:00<h1>

Now let's center it on the page by using css
Once it's done, we'll style the timer so it gets a nice font and round border-radius where we'll click to start later

Next we style the background of the body and timer, so it gets a nice, relaxing gradient color

Now that everything is styled, we'll add an hover interaction on the timer so that it grows a little bit bigger
when hovering
Hovering DONE. But there's a small problem. Cursor becomes 'selecting' when hovering over the text. We need to fix that
Luckily, there's a way to avoid that ! => cursor: pointer;
'cursor' property allows the user to manually decide which of the different cursors it has to be

In order for the timer to work with JavaScript, we'll actually need to separate the minutes and the seconds
This will allow use to work with them easily on the next step, which is to initiate our JS function

Now that everything's done, I saw that a flex-box display won't be great because when we click the timer while it's
already running, the timer obviously goes a bit upper
There's two ways to avoid that:
    1. We set its position to absolute, to make sure it doesn't move when the screen displays another message
Only problem is the added text goes behind the timer, and we want to avoid that
    2. We change the display to a grid, so we can better place all of our elements
